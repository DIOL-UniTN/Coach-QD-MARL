# MultiAgent and QualityDiversity ReinforcementLearning
This repository contains all the main informations about the university and thesis project on Multi Agent Reinforcemnt Learning and Quality Diversity.

## Papers and References
In [references](/references) there is a comprehensive list of references of the studied papers to complete the project.

## Source codes
